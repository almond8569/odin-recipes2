    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>After a few unsuccessful results with my usual go-to checkerboard sables recipe, I stumbled upon this one, also from ATK. One noticeable difference between this recipe and the other is that this one has confectioner's sugar and does not include a mashed up cooked egg yolk. I tried this recipe for the first time on Oct. 15, 2023 and made holiday cut-out cookies. I made one recipe and split the dough into chocolate and strawberry flavors. They turned out great in texture, taste, and looks! I think I prefer this texture to my old checkerboard-sables. I have to test this recipe in checkerboard form.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (2 ounces) confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (11 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ounce semisweet chocolate, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder</li>
      </ul>
      
     
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place butter, granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add egg yolks and vanilla, and beat until combined.  On low-speed, add the flour and mix until just incorporated.  Remove half the dough from the mixing bowl and set aside.  To the remaining half in the mixer, add the melted chocolate and cocoa powder.  Mix on low speed until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Set the two dough onto the counter and shape each into a 9x2 inch rectangle, about 1 inch thick.  Stack the dough to make a 2-inch square log.  Wrap the log tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, place oven racks in the upper and lower-middle positions and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Slice chilled log in half lengthwise, rotating one half to create a checkerboard pattern.  Press gently to re-adhere the halves.  Slice dough into 1/4-inch thick squares and place them onto the baking sheets, spaced about 3/4 inches apart.  Bake until edges are light golden, about 12-15 minutes, rotating the pans midway through baking.  Remove from the oven, let cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
      </ol>
