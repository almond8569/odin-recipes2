  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

      <li>3/8 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/8 granulated sugar</li> 
      <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>4 very ripe bananas</li>
      <li>1/4 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped</li>   
    </ul>  
  <h3>For streusel topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter, slightly softened and cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped walnuts</li> 
    </ul>   

  <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Make streusel topping: Mix flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined.Cut in the butter until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in chopped walnuts. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Cream the butter and sugars in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. With a wooden spoon, stir in the mashed bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla. Slowly stir in the dry ingredients until just incorporated. Gently stir in walnuts. The batter will be thick.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the batter. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven and cool 10-15 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Remove the bread from the pan and continue to cool on the wire rack. Once fully cooled, wrap and store at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
