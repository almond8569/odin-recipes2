   <h1>Moist Pumpkin Loaf</h1>
   <img src=>
   <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This moist pumpkin loaf has no butter and uses a combination of oil and water to hydrate the batter. Best of all, it can be made in one bowl!</p>
 
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
       <li>1 cup oil</li>
       <li>4 eggs</li>
       <li>15-16 ounces canned pumpkin (1 can)</li>
       <li>1/2 cup water</li>
       <li>3 cups flour</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon cloves</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon allspice</li>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>Grease 2 standard (8.5 x 4.5-inch) loaf pans (or 4 to 5 mini loaf pans depending on what size you are using — don’t fill pans higher than 2/3 full) with butter or non-stick spray.</li>
       <li>Using a stand mixer or hand mixer or simply a whisk, beat sugar and oil together until blended. Add eggs one at a time mixing after each addition. Add pumpkin purée and water and mix until blended.</li>
       <li>Add the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Whisk only until just incorporated.</li>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li> 
       <li>Pour batter into prepared pans. Do not fill pans more than 2/3 full.</li>
       <li>Bake for about an hour (if using standard loaf pans) but start checking for doneness after 45 minutes — the loaves are done when the center springs back when touched. Note: When using the small pans, the loaves should be done in under 45 minutes. Start checking after 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Let cool 15-20 minutes in pan; then transfer to a cooling rack to continue cooling before cutting and serving.</li>
     </ol>

       Original recipe calls for 2 cups sugar, which would be extremely sweet, and 3/4 cups water. The cake as made with thea bove measurements is already sweet enough and very moist.
